Very experimental RTTY code for PecanPico4 hardware (that can be used instead of the APRS version)
This code is heavily borrowed from James Coxon (with modifications from Anthony Stirk)

In this version of the software the FSK is generated digitally and must be transferred from the ATMega to the Si4464 GPIO pin.
